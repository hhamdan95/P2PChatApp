*This project is part of the Development of Distributed Systems (GEIAL519-Ma) course at Informatics Institute of the University of Miskolc.*

A simple Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Chat Application built using Java sockets and multithreading.  
### Demonstration
![demo](https://github.com/hhamdan95/P2PChatApp/blob/master/demo.png?raw=true)
### Requirements
- Ensure that the latest version of [Java](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/) is installed on your computer, and JAVA_HOME is configured as a environment variable.
- This application was compiled using the latest Java Development Kit version (JDK 17); therefore, if you face any errors like "...compiled by a recent version", you can re-compile the app with an older version of Javac or install the latest JDK version.
- Another option would be to import the project to an IDE like Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA and re-build it.
### How to run?
1. Run the server: `start-server.bat`.
2. Run the client: `start-server.bat`. (Note: You can run multiple clients!)
3. Enjoy chatting!
